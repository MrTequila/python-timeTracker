# python-timeTracker

Program that I started to write that should keep track of which app you have open for how long.
Data is written in SQLite db with SQLAlchemy library.
Information about currently open and focused window is made by WinEventHook with ctypes library.
GUI is made in kivy library - data visualization with PieChart - my separate repository: https://github.com/MrTequila/kivy-PieChart
